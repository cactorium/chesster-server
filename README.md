# chesster-server
(WIP) Back end for Chess server

This is meant to work with the Android app [here](https://github.com/cactorium/chesster-app)

Maybe eventually include a web version that'll run from the same server

## Basic architecture

- [ ] SQLite database for backend
  - [ ] Stores user login info (username + salted password hash) [TODO: explore using additional authentication using a key stored in the Android app that can be revoked by the user]
  - [ ] Stores board history
  - [ ] Stores latest board configuration
  - [ ] (Extra feature): friend's list
  - [ ] Allow spectating on (public) matches
- [ ] Chess engine
  - [ ] Validates moves
  - [ ] Validates board history
  - [ ] Determines checkmate/stalemate
  - [ ] Flags mates
- [ ] TCP-based server
  - [ ] Authenticates users and provides secure tokens
  - [ ] Validates packets
  - [ ] Allows account management
  - [ ] Provides push notifications
  - [ ] Password recovery
  - [ ] Specify packet format
  - [ ] Specify payloads using Protobuf
- [ ] CLI client (used for testing server)
  - [ ] Can communication with server
  - [ ] Can read in test patterns from stdin for integration testing
  - [ ] Can log in
  - [ ] Can list matches
  - [ ] Can start match
  - [ ] Can make a move
  - [ ] Can display board
  - [ ] Lets you play chess from the command line
- [ ] Maybe eventually web app
  - [ ] Lets you play chess online

## Protocol
We'll use a gRPC server for communication, with all messages except for push notifications being serviced by the gRPC service on TCP port 8888.
Authentication will be done using an authentication service on 8888, with all other service types containing a header with authentication details.
Push notifications will be sent as packets using the keys from the authentication handshake on TCP port 8888 on a connection on port 8889.

### Message header

|Name            | Protobuf type    |Description                    |
|----------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Version        | varint    | Version number, currently 0 |
| Type           | enum      | Packet type |
| Session token  | bytes     | Authentication token received in handshake |
| Server nonce   | bytes     | Nonce generated by server |
| Client none    | bytes     | Nonce chosen by client |
| HMAC           | bytes     | Hash((Key1 xor padding1) + Hash((Key2 xor padding2) + snonce + message + cnonce + token)) |

Key1 and Key2 will be different depending on whether the packet originated from the client, or server, and all four keys will be generated during the handshake

### Handshake
TODO: needs to generate a session token and key for each session

Handshake will be initiated a packet of type zero, where the HMAC is ignored.

### Packet types
TODO
